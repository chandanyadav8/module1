reate a class called CakeBaker that is dependent on two other components: Frosting and Syrup.

The CakeBaker class should have a method called bakeCake().

Create two interfaces named Frosting and Syrup, each having a method called getFrostingType() and getSyrupType(), respectively.

Provide two implementations for each interface (a total of four implementation classes):

Chocolate and Strawberry flavors for Frosting

Chocolate and Strawberry flavors for Syrup

Use Dependency Injection to inject the Frosting and Syrup dependencies into the CakeBaker class, and invoke the bakeCake() method.
